## Custom Tiles

Custom tiles can be used to define tiles that are not part of the standard tile set.
They can then be referenced in the `tiles` field of a puzzle by their name.
The value of each entry in the `custom_tiles` map is a tile definition, which is explained in the [Tiles](#tiles)
section below.
You can also override standard tiles by defining a custom tile with the same name.
Standard tiles are shown below.

## Custom Boards

Custom boards can be used to define boards that you want to reuse in multiple puzzles.
They can then be referenced in the `board` field of a puzzle by their name.
The value of each entry in the `custom_boards` map is a board definition, which is explained in the [Board](#board)
section below.

## Puzzles

A puzzle describes a single challenge for the user to solve.
It has the following fields:

| Field           | Type                  | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Default   |

## Tiles

A tile defines a shape that can be placed on the board.
Tiles can be defined in two ways: by name or with an array.

### Name

A tile can be referenced by its name as a `String`.
Those tiles are either standard tiles (see below) or custom tiles defined in the `custom_tiles` map.

Example:

```json
"L3"
```

The following standard tiles are available:

| Name            | Shape                                                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trominoes**   |                                                                           |
| `I3`            | ![I3 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/3/I3.svg){.inline-svg} |

| **Pentominoes** |                                                                           |
| `F5`            | ![F5 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/F5.svg){.inline-svg} |
| `I5`            | ![I5 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/I5.svg){.inline-svg} |
| `L5`            | ![L5 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/L5.svg){.inline-svg} |
| `N5`            | ![N5 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/N5.svg){.inline-svg} |

| `W5`            | ![W5 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/W5.svg){.inline-svg} |
| `X5`            | ![X5 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/X5.svg){.inline-svg} |
| `Y5`            | ![Y5 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/Y5.svg){.inline-svg} |
| `Z5`            | ![I3 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/Z5.svg){.inline-svg} |

### Array

A tile can also be defined by a 2D array of integers.
The array represents the shape of the tile, where `1` indicates a filled cell and `0` indicates an empty cell.

For example, the following array defines a Z5 tile:

<!-- @formatter:off -->
```json
[
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1]
]
```
<!-- @formatter:on -->

Which, as a reminder, looks like this:

![Z5 Tile](site/assets/images/puzzled/tiles/5/Z5.svg){.inline-svg}

## Board

A board defines the layout on which the puzzle is to be solved.
There are two variants of boards, which can be defined in three ways, so pay attention.
Boards can be referenced by name, defined as a [Simple Board](#simple-board) or as an [Area Board](#area-board).

### Name

Similar to tiles, a board can be referenced by its name as a `String`.
Standard boards or custom boards defined in the `custom_boards` map can be referenced this way.

Example:

```json
"my_custom_board"
```

The following format of standard boards are available:

You can define a simple rectangular board of any size using the following naming scheme:
`<width>x<height>`, where `<width>` and `<height>` are positive integers.
The following board definitions will result in the same board:

```json
"4x3"
```

<!-- @formatter:off -->
```json
{
    "layout": [
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
```
<!-- @formatter:on -->

### Simple Board

A simple board is defined by a 2D array of integers, where `0` indicates an empty cell where a tile can be placed and
`1` indicates a blocked cell where no tile can be placed.

| Field  | Type         | Required | Description                                                                              | Default   |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| layout | `Array2<u8>` | true     | The layout of the board where `0` indicates empty cells and `1` indicates blocked cells. | -         |

Example:

<!-- @formatter:off -->
```json
{
    "layout": [
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
```
<!-- @formatter:on -->

Here, tiles can be placed in all cells except the one in the center.

### Area Board

An area board is a board, where one cell has to be left empty in each area when solving the puzzle.
This is the board type used in the original Puzzle A Day.

| Field           | Type             | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Default |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| area_layout     | `Array2<i32>`    | true     | The layout of the areas on the board. `-1` indicates, that no tile can be placed in this cell. The rest is the index of the area the cell belongs to. The index starts at `0` and goes up to the length of the areas list minus one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | -       |
| values          | `Array2<String>` | true     | The values to show in each cell. Entries MUST not be empty, when the area_layout is not `-1` in the corresponding cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | -       |
| value_order     | `Array2<i32>`    | true     | The order of values. This order is used to sort the options when selecting a target. `-1` marks cells that no tile can be placed in. The rest of the values MUST be any non-negative number and MAY not start at zero and MAY not be consecutive. The natural order of the number is the only thing that matters. If the same number appears more than once in an area, the behavior is undefined.                                                                                                                                      | -       |

| target_template | `String`         | true     | Template to format a target selected by the user. This is shown to inform the user about the currently selected target. The formatters defined in the area are used to format the value from the board values array. In the template, `{<area_index>}` is replaced with the formatted value. So `{0} and {1}` is a template for a baord with two areas. The resulting string may look like this: `first and second`, where `first` is the formatted value from the first area and `second` is the formatted vlaue from the second area. | -       |

Example:

Example:

```json
{
    "name": "Day",

    },
    "default_factory": {
        "type": "CurrentDay"
    }
}
```

#### Area Formatter

The area formatter takes the raw value from the board and formats it for display to the user.

##### Plain

Returns the value as is.

```json
{
    "type": "PLain"

```

##### Nth

Appends "st", "nd", "rd" or "th" to the value based on its last character.
It is expected that the value ends with a digit.

```json
{
    "type": "Nth"
}
```

##### PrefixSuffix

Appends a prefix and/or suffix to the value.

```json
{
    "type": "PrefixSuffix",
    "prefix": "x",
    "suffix": "z"
}

```json
{
    "type": "CurrentMonthShort"
}
