## About me

Hello, welcome to my website. I am Tilman, and I am a graduate student at the Carl von Ossietzky University of
Oldenburg.
I am passionate about computer science and like to explore new technologies and ideas.

This website is a platform for me to share my projects, thoughts, and experiences with the world.
It is very new and I currently do not have much content here, but I plan to add more in the future.

You can find a collection of my projects in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Til7701).
