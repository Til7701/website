This website is a platform for me to share my projects, thoughts, and experiences with the world.
It is very new and I currently do not have much content here, but I plan to add more in the future.

You can find a collection of my projects in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Til7701) profile.
<!--Some of the projects are also listed on the [Projects](/projects) page.
The projects page gives a brief overview of each project, along with links to the source code and any relevant

## About me

Hello, welcome to my website. I'm Tilman, and I am a graduate student at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg.
I am passionate about computer science and like to explore new technologies and ideas.
This interest started early, when by dad showed me C# and tasked me to create simple command line programs.
Since then, I have worked on various projects, both personal and academic, and have gained experience in different
programming languages and frameworks.
I used C# a bit more in school, but left it behind when I started my studies.
Most of my projects are now using Java and the Spring Boot framework, if applicable, but I also tried out other
languages like Rust, PHP, Python, and JavaScript.
