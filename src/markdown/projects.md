This page is an overview of my projects.

## This Website

[GitHub](https://github.com/Til7701/website)

This website is obviously one of my projects.
It is based on a website I developed with some others for a university course called "Internet Technologies".
It uses PHP to render the pages and SCSS for styling.
The content is mostly written in Markdown and converted to HTML using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
